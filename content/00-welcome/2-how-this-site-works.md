# How This Site Works

Welcome. This site is built on the **JASYTI Principle** — a communication rule that says most of the value you’ll get from a page sits right at the top.

## The JASYTI Principle

> **80% of what you need to know lives in 20% of the page — the introduction and the headers.**  
> The remaining 20% adds depth, examples, and context.

That means you can scan the intro and section titles to get the main ideas fast, then stay if you want the full story.

## Why It Works

The JASYTI Principle stands on the shoulders of proven communication models:

- **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule):** A small amount of input creates most of the output.  
- **Inverted Pyramid:** Lead with the “so what,” then fill in details.  
- **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** State the main point before the explanation.  
- **F-Pattern Reading:** Readers focus on the top and left — make it count.

## What to Expect

- Every page starts with the **core takeaway.**  
- Headings summarize meaning, not just label sections.  
- Context, examples, and deeper notes live below the fold.  

You’ll never have to dig for the point — it’ll meet you first.

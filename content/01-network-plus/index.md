# Category 1 Home — CompTIA Network Plus

## Course Overview

Welcome to **Category 1: Network Plus**, a full exploration of modern networking.  
This section follows CompTIA’s Network+ curriculum and introduces you to the essential principles that underpin network communications.  
You’ll learn how networks are designed, built, secured, and maintained—and gain the confidence to speak the language of networking professionals.

The course begins with **networking concepts**, helping you master protocols, cabling, and standards so you can read, write, and talk “network.”  
From there, you’ll progress into **network implementation**, where we move from concepts into hands-on configuration—deploying routing and switching technologies in realistic scenarios.  
Next comes **network operations**, covering documentation, procedures, and operational best practices to keep systems healthy and scalable.  
You’ll also dig into **network security**, understanding how to protect infrastructure and data from common threats.  
Finally, you’ll apply everything through **network troubleshooting**, learning methodologies to diagnose and resolve physical, logical, and cloud-based network issues.

> No prior networking experience is required, but a basic understanding of computing infrastructure will help.  
> If you bring curiosity and consistency, this category will build the foundation you need for the Network+ exam—and real-world networking roles.

## Quizzes, Master Quiz, and Learning Flow

Each module concludes with a short **quiz** covering the concepts introduced in that section.  
These quizzes reinforce what you’ve learned and ensure you can recognize and recall key terms and processes before moving on.  
After completing all modules, you’ll unlock a **Master Quiz**, which serves as a cumulative review and readiness check for the certification exam.  

To move forward confidently:
- Aim for **85 % or higher** on each quiz before continuing.  
- Review any missed questions and revisit the related pages or glossary entries until the ideas click.

The **Glossary** (linked throughout the site) is your primary reference for unfamiliar terms.  
Follow the internal **wiki links** (`[[Term]]`) embedded in each lesson—they connect related pages, letting you explore supporting concepts without leaving the flow of study.

## Learning Philosophy

Every index page carries the same core idea: we’re not training you to become a **subject-matter expert** on the first pass.  
Instead, this system aims to take you to **Level 2 of Bloom’s Taxonomy**—the **understanding** stage—where you can explain what a concept means and see how it fits into the bigger picture.  

From there, the goal is to help you reach **Level 3 (application)** through guided practice and quizzes.  
This progression parallels the **four stages of competence**:
1. *Unconscious incompetence* — you don’t know what you don’t know.  
2. *Conscious incompetence* — you know what you don’t know.  
3. *Conscious competence* — you can apply what you know.  
4. *Unconscious competence* — mastery.

At the start of each page, the introduction and headers give you enough to reach the *“I know what I don’t know”* stage—  
you’ll start asking better questions and recognizing gaps.  
The paragraphs and linked resources that follow are there to help you move from understanding to application, solidified through repetition and assessment.
